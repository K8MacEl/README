Hello ðŸ‘‹,

I am excited to apply for the Front End Engineer position at README. Throughout my career I found myself leaning into technical projects but as a Project Manager I recognized my need for a more formal background in software engineering to continue further with this area. So I decided to build my software engineering skill set in order to grow by enrolling full time in a Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp with General Assembly.
 
My journey in software engineering has been fueled by years of experience in the affordable housing sector, where I honed my skills in developing solutions under resource constraints and complex environments.  This has equipped me with a unique perspective on software development, focusing on user-centric and impactful solutions. In 2019 I launched a CRM tool, Neighborly, for my former organization, DURA, to allow the housing team to manage all their loan and grant programs in a centralized location, which was a lifeline for allowing remote work during the pandemic. In this launch, I first mapped out the needs of the programs and compiled it in a wire frame and ERD for the software engineers. Then I led the UX testing during the beta mode and later was responsible for the data migration of over 10,000 loan files. This was my first deep dive into product and CRMs and it has fueled my passion ever since.

I have successfully led several software development projects in my former roles, such as developing a web application and CRM tool coupled with implementing an API built by Aeyon for the USDA Funded Farm and Food Worker program. I later went on to conduct testing for the Aeyon tool as I noticed a potential bug in the application that would compromise the applicationâ€™s ability to correctly check the applicant against the database to ensure duplicate payments were not being made. I escalated this bug to Aeyon and worked with the Aeyon team on testing and finding a solution of adding an additional match logic to the application, this prevented over 10,000 duplicate applications from being processed which saved over $6M.  These projects have not only sharpened my technical skills but also enhanced my capabilities in managing large-scale, multifaceted projects. 

My proficiency in languages and frameworks such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, Express, React, and NodeJS, coupled with my experience in database management using MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Django position me well to contribute effectively to your team. I am well versed in RESTful APIs, have built full stack applications with JSON data transfers to MongoDB, have a strong foundation of JavaScript, and enjoy the front end element of CSS and HTML. Most recently, I built a full MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) stack web based application, HQSpec, as a freelance project to improve the process of public housing authorities requesting inspections for housing choice voucher properties. I am also currently working with clients to build their own professional portfolios on Wordpress as well as working with smaller nonprofits to enhance their websites.

After working with small start-up nonprofits, I am very comfortable juggling multiple priorities, I take curveballs daily and am always problem solving. Additionally learning from a Bootcamp has pushed me to build full stack web based applications with a one week turnaround.  I am a skilled juggler and a fast mover with a balance of attention to detail and intentionality expected of my stakeholders and know how to be efficient in my work. When the clock starts ticking I take initiative. Here is a link to my <src=https://katemcelhaney.com/14-2/>resume </scr> I look forward to further discussing this position with you.

Sincerely,

Kate McElhaney
